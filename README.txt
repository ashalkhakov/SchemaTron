### FAST SCHEMATRON FOR .NET
Are you a .NET developer who needs to validate XML files against schematron specs? 
Are you tired of having to carry around with you Saxon DLLs which wrap Java bytecode?
Do you need greater performance than you can get launching a separate process each time you want to check an XML file against the schematron rules to which it must conform?

Then this is the project for you!
